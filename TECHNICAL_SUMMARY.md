# Technical Summary

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a modern, multi-tenant project management system with a clear separation between backend and frontend concerns.

### Backend Architecture (Django + GraphQL)

#### Data Models
- **Organization**: Root entity for multi-tenancy
- **Project**: Belongs to an organization, contains tasks
- **Task**: Belongs to a project, can have comments
- **TaskComment**: Belongs to a task, provides collaboration features

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Multi-tenancy Implementation**
   - Organization-based data isolation
   - All queries filter by organization slug
   - Cascade deletion ensures data integrity
   - No cross-organization data leakage

2. **GraphQL Schema Design**
   - Single endpoint for all operations
   - Nested relationships (Project → Tasks → Comments)
   - Computed fields for statistics (task counts, completion rates)
   - Input validation at the schema level

3. **Data Validation**
   - Email validation for contact and assignee fields
   - Field constraints (max lengths, required fields)
   - Status choices with predefined options
   - Date/time handling with timezone awareness

### Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

#### Component Structure
- **Pages**: Dashboard, ProjectView
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with TypeScript interfaces
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Client integration with proper caching
- **State Management**: Apollo Client cache + local state

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Type Safety**
   - Full TypeScript implementation
   - Generated types from GraphQL schema
   - Strict type checking for all components

2. **Component Composition**
   - Small, focused components
   - Props-based communication
   - Consistent styling with TailwindCSS

3. **GraphQL Integration**
   - Apollo Client for state management
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Cache management for performance

## Technical Implementation Details

### Multi-tenancy Strategy

The system implements **organization-based multi-tenancy** with the following characteristics:

```python
# All queries filter by organization
def resolve_projects(self, info, organization_slug=None):
    if organization_slug:
        return Project.objects.filter(organization__slug=organization_slug)
    return Project.objects.all()
```

**Benefits:**
- Simple to implement and understand
- Good performance with proper indexing
- Easy to extend with additional tenant-specific features
- Clear data boundaries

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires organization context in all operations
- Database queries need organization filtering
- Potential for data leakage if not implemented carefully

### GraphQL Schema Design

The GraphQL schema follows these principles:

1. **Nested Relationships**: Projects contain tasks, tasks contain comments
2. **Computed Fields**: Task statistics calculated on-demand
3. **Input Validation**: Structured input types for mutations
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for failed operations

```graphql
type Project {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  status: ProjectStatus!
  taskStats: TaskStats!  # Computed field
  tasks: [Task!]!        # Nested relationship
}
```

### Database Design

#### Relationships
- Organization (1) → Projects (N)
- Project (1) → Tasks (N)
- Task (1) → Comments (N)

#### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for performance
- Slug index on Organization for fast lookups
- Status indexes for filtering

#### Constraints
- Unique organization slugs
- Email validation
- Required fields enforcement
- Cascade deletion for data integrity

### Frontend State Management

#### Apollo Client Configuration
```typescript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    typePolicies: {
      Project: {
        fields: {
          tasks: {
            merge(existing = [], incoming) {
              return incoming;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })
});
```

#### State Flow
1. **Server State**: Managed by Apollo Client cache
2. **Local State**: React useState for UI state
3. **Form State**: Controlled components with validation
4. **Loading States**: Apollo Client loading indicators

### Performance Considerations

#### Backend
- Database query optimization
- GraphQL field selection
- Caching strategies
- Pagination for large datasets

#### Frontend
- Component memoization
- Lazy loading
- Optimistic updates
- Efficient re-renders

## Security Implementation

### Data Isolation
- Organization-based filtering in all queries
- No cross-organization data access
- Proper foreign key constraints

### Input Validation
- GraphQL schema validation
- Django model validation
- Frontend form validation

### CORS Configuration

- Credential support
- Development vs production settings

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for models
- Integration tests for GraphQL schema
- Test coverage for all CRUD operations

### Frontend Testing

- Data migration scripts
- Rollback procedures

### Environment Configuration
- Environment variables for secrets
